# NextJs Blog

Boilerplate with all the components required to make a fully functional SEO optimized blog through NextJs with both SSR(on posts list page) and SSG using Incremental Static Regeneration(on post page).

- Strapi as Content manager
- Disqus Embedded for comments
- Markdown blog
- ThemeUI for components, theme and dark mode
- SEO through next-seo
- Pagination
- Remark and Remark-html for markdown to html
- [Github markdown css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) for posts

##### Special thanks to Scott Moss and Frontend Masters for the amazing NextJs workshop.


While you can also use github-markdown-css using npm or CDN link, but it doesn't supports dark mode. Its CSS in this repo is refractored to support dark mode.
